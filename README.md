# uCycle

## Let's make Timisoara plasticless.

---

  UCycle brings you a webapp where you can see in real time the closest recycle container near you 
and based on what the container is for the user will see a different color on the map.
   The app provides a feedback system which tells how full is a container. The results are going
to the cityhall page.
